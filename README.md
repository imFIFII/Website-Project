This is my personal project ish type website,which i have made for cs50 problem set using html,css and liddol bit of javascript.I had many different ideas in my mind while creating this website...but i failed to do so,Hopefully i will be executing those ideas in future aka polishing this website more and trying to make this as responsive as possible.
